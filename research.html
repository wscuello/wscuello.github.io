                            In my research, I am interested in how environmental fluctuations play a role in demographic stochasticity. In particular, I investigate, by data-driven and theoretical means, how environmental fluctuations affect single- and multispecies systems. I am also interested in constructing or using mathematical frameworks for analyzing species-to-species interactions. <br><br>For my thesis, and under the supervision of my advisor, Dr. Sebastian Schreiber at UC Davis, I created a mathematical framework for analyzing whether an arbitrary number of interacting species would stochastically persist in a randomly fluctuating environment. Currently, I am working under Dr. Konstantin Mischaikow at Rutgers University to adapt their mathematical framework for analyzing gene regulatory networks to ecological networks.

                                        <p>In this paper, we tracked the year-to-year densities of ten Sonoran Desert winter annuals by creating ten bet-hedging, stochastic models. We parameterized these models using 30 years of seed yield and precipitation data. In doing so, we were able to predict average germination rates for each species, and see to what extent variation in precipitation alone drove these germination rates. We also statistically found to what extent seed survivorship and functional responses to precipitation drove these average germination rates. Please see below for full manuscript! </p>
